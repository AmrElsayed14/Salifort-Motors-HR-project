Machine learning models to predict whether the employee will leave the company or stay depending on HR dataset

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. As a data analytics professional, I provided data-driven suggestions based on my understanding of the data. I understood from the data given, what’s likely to make the employee leave the company.
Based on the thorough analysis of the data collected by the HR department, I have successfully developed a highly accurate model that can predict an employee's likelihood of leaving the company with up to 95% precision.
